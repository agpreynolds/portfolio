	<p>Web developer specialising in JavaScript and PHP currently based in Portsmouth, UK.</p>
	<p>My passion for development started in 2012 when I was introduced to web programming as part of my degree. Since then I have undertaken various mini projects in my free time to further my skills and develop new ones.</p>
	<p>I consider myself to be proficient in all areas of web development, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript and PHP. In addition I also have some experience in web programming using Perl and Java EE as development languages.</p>
	<p>My current interests involve integrating web API's and this has led to me working with Twitter, Google Feeds, Google Maps and various other API's on recent projects.</p>
